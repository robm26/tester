# tester

Database developers need both vision and experience to create effective database applications. Knowing the full feature set of the database service is a start, but it's difficult to know in advance whether a particular solution will meet performance and efficienty requrements. 


This testing framework will allow you to:
1. Craft and run benchmark test routines, such as:
   * 1000 reads requests
   * 1000 write requests 
2. Gather latency statistics from each routine  
3. Perform analysis showing average and p99 latency 
4. Compare the results of tests side by side
